            <p><h1>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”</h1>
                As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
                feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
                down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br>
                Dr. Cardona explains. <br>
                “‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
                protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
                protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
                exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” <br>
                <h1>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
                    including other vaccinated people?</h1> <br>
                While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
                that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br>
                “The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
                not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
                and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations." <br></p>
